# Editable runtime dependencies (equivalent to install_requires)
# Add direct runtime dependencies here, as well as implicit dependencies
# with constrained versions.
#
# After editing, update requirements/main.txt by running:
#     make update-deps

# This is most of it: contains the repository scanning tools
# That doesn't have delete methods; someday we should put it in Safir, but
# for now we'll just roll our own.
